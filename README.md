# Test Code for NeoMutt Libraries

**NOTES**

- They work for me, YMMV
- They may get deleted without warning
- They expect NeoMutt to be built in `../neo`

**SAMPLES**

- `test_lib` calls a function from each library source files
- `test_hcache` creates an entry in the header cache and retrieves it
